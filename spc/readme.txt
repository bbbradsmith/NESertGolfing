Lizard NES SPC
==============

This is an emulation of a subset of NES sound for the SNES SPC,
originally used in the SNES port of Lizard:
* https://rainwarrior.ca/lizard/

This is intended to make it easy to port an NES sound program to the SNES.
It does not support DPCM, envelopes, length counter, or sweeps.
See notes at the top of snes.spc.s for more information.
See the parent project for example of usage within in a real SNES program.

Core files:
* snes.spc.s - SPC program source code.
* build_spc.bat - Builds spc.bin using WLA-DX.
* snes.spc.link - Linker list for WLA-DX.
* snes.spc.tab.py - Python 3 script to rebuild snes.spc.tab.inc.
* readme.txt - You are reading this.

Generated files: (can be rebuilt)
* spc.bin - Pre-built SPC binary, usable if you don't need to make changes to the code.
* snes.spc.tab.inc - Waveform and other tables generated by snes.spc.tab.py.


wlalink and wla-spc700 are required to rebuild the SPC program:
